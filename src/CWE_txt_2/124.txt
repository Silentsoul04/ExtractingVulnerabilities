CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')

Description
The software writes to a buffer using an index or pointer that references a memory location prior to the beginning of the buffer.
Extended Description
This typically occurs when a pointer or its index is decremented to a position before the buffer, when pointer arithmetic results in a position before the beginning of the valid memory location, or when a negative index is used.
Relationships
The table(s) below shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOr and give insight to similar items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that may want to be explored.

Applicable Platforms

Language : C++ (Prevalence = Undetermined) Alternate Terms
buffer underrun : Some prominent vendors and researchers use the term "buffer underrun". "Buffer underflow" is more commonly used, although both terms are also sometimes used to describe a buffer under-read (CWE-127).

CWE-124: Buffer Underwrite ('Buffer Underflow')
Impact Likelihood
Out of bounds memory access will very likely result in the corruption of relevant memory, and perhaps instructions, possibly leading to a crash.
Integrity Confidentiality Availability Access Control Other
Execute Unauthorized Code or Commands Modify Memory
Bypass Protection Mechanism
Other
If the corrupted memory can be effectively controlled, it may be possible to execute arbitrary code. If the corrupted memory is data rather than instructions, the system will continue to function with improper changes, possibly in violation of an implicit or explicit policy. The consequences would only be limited by how the affected data is used, such as an adjacent memory location that is used to specify whether the user has special privileges.
Access Control Bypass Protection Mechanism Other Other
When the consequence is arbitrary code execution, this can often be used to subvert any other security service.
Potential Mitigations
Requirements specification: The choice could be made to use a language that is not susceptible to these issues.
Phase: Implementation
Sanity checks should be performed on all calculated values used as index or for pointer arithmetic.

Notes
Relationship
This could be resultant from several errors, including a bad offset or an array index that decrements before the beginning of the buffer (see CWE-129).
Research Gap
Much attention has been paid to buffer overflows, but "underflows" sometimes exist in products that are relatively free of overflows, so it is likely that this variant has been under-studied.
