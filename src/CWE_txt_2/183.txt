CWE-183: Permissive List of Allowed Inputs
Description
The product implements a protection mechanism that relies on a list of inputs (or properties of inputs) that are explicitly allowed by policy because the inputs are assumed to be safe, but the list is too permissive - that is, it allows an input that is unsafe, leading to resultant weaknesses.
Relationships
The table(s) below shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOr and give insight to similar items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that may want to be explored.

Applicable Platforms
Language : Language-Independent (Prevalence = Undetermined) Alternate Terms
Allowlist / Allow List : This is used by CWE and CAPEC instead of other commonly-used terms. Its counterpart is denylist.
Safelist / Safe List : This is often used by security tools such as firewalls, email or web gateways, proxies, etc.
Whitelist / White List : This term is frequently used, but usage has been declining as organizations have started to adopt other terms.
