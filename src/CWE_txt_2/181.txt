CWE-181: Incorrect Behavior Order: Validate Before Filter
Description
The software validates data before it has been filtered, which prevents the software from detecting data that becomes invalid after the filtering step.
Extended Description
This can be used by an attacker to bypass the validation and launch attacks that expose weaknesses that would otherwise be prevented, such as injection.
