CWE-187: Partial String Comparison
Description
The software performs a comparison that only examines a portion of a factor before determining whether there is a match, such as a substring, leading to resultant weaknesses.
Extended Description
For example, an attacker might succeed in authentication by providing a small password that matches the associated portion of the larger, correct password.
Relationships
The table(s) below shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOr and give insight to similar items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction.
