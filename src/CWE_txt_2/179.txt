CWE-179: Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Validation
Description
The software validates input before applying protection mechanisms that modify the input, which could allow an attacker to bypass the validation via dangerous inputs that only arise after the modification.
Extended Description
Software needs to validate data at the proper time, after data has been canonicalized and cleansed. Early validation is susceptible to various manipulations that result in dangerous inputs that are produced by canonicalization and cleansing.

CWE Version 4.2
CWE-179: Incorrect Behavior Order: Early Validation
  Inputs should be decoded and canonicalized to the application's current internal representation before being validated (CWE-180). Make sure that the application does not decode the same input twice (CWE-174). Such errors could be used to bypass allowlist validation schemes by introducing dangerous inputs after they have been checked.
CVE-2003-0332 Product modifies the first two letters of a filename extension after performing a security check, which allows remote attackers to bypass authentication via a
filename with a .ats extension instead of a .hts extension.

CVE-2002-0802 Database consumes an extra character when processing a character that cannot be converted, which could remove an escape character from the query
and make the application subject to SQL injection attacks.
