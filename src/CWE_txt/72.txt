CWE-72: Improper Handling of Apple HFS+ Alternate Data Stream Path
Description
The software does not properly handle special paths that may identify the data or resource fork of a file on the HFS+ file system.
Extended Description
If the software chooses actions to take based on the file name, then if an attacker provides the data or resource fork, the software may take unexpected actions. Further, if the software intends to restrict access to a file, then an attacker might still be able to bypass intended access restrictions by requesting the data or resource fork for that file.

Applicable Platforms
Language : Language-Independent (Prevalence = Undetermined)
Operating_System : macOS (Prevalence = Undetermined) Background Details
The Apple HFS+ file system permits files to have multiple data input streams, accessible through special paths. The Mac OS X operating system provides a way to access the different data input streams through special paths and as an extended attribute:
- Resource fork: file/..namedfork/rsrc, file/rsrc (deprecated), xattr:com.apple.ResourceFork - Data fork: file/..namedfork/data (only versions prior to Mac OS X v10.5)
Additionally, on filesystems that lack native support for multiple streams, the resource fork and file metadata may be stored in a file with "._" prepended to the name.
Forks can also be accessed through non-portable APIs.
Forks inherit the file system access controls of the file they belong to.
Programs need to control access to these paths, if the processing of a file system object is dependent on the structure of its path.

   Demonstrative Examples
Example 1:
A web server that interprets FILE.cgi as processing instructions could disclose the source code for FILE.cgi by requesting FILE.cgi/..namedfork/data. This might occur because the web server invokes the default handler which may return the contents of the file.

Notes
Theoretical
This and similar problems exist because the same resource can have multiple identifiers that dictate which behavior can be performed on the resource.
