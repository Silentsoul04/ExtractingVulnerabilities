CWE-62: UNIX Hard Link
Description
The software, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently account for when the name is associated with a hard link to a target that is outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the software to operate on unauthorized files.
Extended Description
Failure for a system to check for hard links can result in vulnerability to different types of attacks. For example, an attacker can escalate their privileges if a file used by a privileged program is replaced with a hard link to a sensitive file (e.g. /etc/passwd). When the process opens the file, the attacker can assume the privileges of that process.
Relationships
The table(s) below shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOr and give insight to similar items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that may want to be explored.

   Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy = Separation of Privilege
Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to entities in a software system. Denying access to a file can prevent an attacker from replacing that file with a link to a sensitive file. Ensure good compartmentalization in the system to provide protected areas that can be trusted.

Description
Hard link attack, file overwrite; interesting because program checks against soft links
https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2001-1494
Hard link and possibly symbolic link following vulnerabilities in embedded operating system allow local users to overwrite arbitrary files. https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2002-0793
Server creates hard links and unlinks files as root, which allows local users to gain privileges by deleting and overwriting arbitrary files.
