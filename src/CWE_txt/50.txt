CWE-50: Path Equivalence: '//multiple/leading/slash'
Description
A software system that accepts path input in the form of multiple leading slash ('//multiple/leading/ slash') without appropriate validation can lead to ambiguous path resolution and allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.
