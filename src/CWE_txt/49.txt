CWE-49: Path Equivalence: 'filename/' (Trailing Slash)
Description
A software system that accepts path input in the form of trailing slash ('filedir/') without appropriate validation can lead to ambiguous path resolution and allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.
