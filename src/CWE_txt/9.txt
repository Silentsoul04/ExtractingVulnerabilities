CWE-9: J2EE Misconfiguration: Weak Access Permissions for EJB Methods

Description
If elevated access rights are assigned to EJB methods, then an attacker can take advantage of the permissions to exploit the software system.
Extended Description
If the EJB deployment descriptor contains one or more method permissions that grant access to the special ANYONE role, it indicates that access control for the application has not been fully thought through or that the application is structured in such a way that reasonable access control restrictions are impossible.
Relationships
The table(s) below shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOr and give insight to similar items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that may want to be explored.
Relevant to the view "Research Concepts" (CWE-1000)
ChildOf 266 Incorrect Privilege Assignment 582
Common Consequences
Other Other
Potential Mitigations
Phase: Architecture and Design Phase: System Configuration
Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to EJB methods. Permission to invoke EJB methods should not be granted to the ANYONE role.
Demonstrative Examples
Example 1:
The following deployment descriptor grants ANYONE permission to invoke the Employee EJB's method named getSalary().
Example Language: XML (bad)
