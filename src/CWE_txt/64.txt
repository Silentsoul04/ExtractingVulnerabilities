CWE-64: Windows Shortcut Following (.LNK)
Description
  114
CWE-64: Windows Shortcut Following (.LNK)
CWE Version 4.2
CWE-64: Windows Shortcut Following (.LNK)
The software, when opening a file or directory, does not sufficiently handle when the file is a Windows shortcut (.LNK) whose target is outside of the intended control sphere. This could allow an attacker to cause the software to operate on unauthorized files.
Extended Description
The shortcut (file with the .lnk extension) can permit an attacker to read/write a file that they originally did not have permissions to access.

         Phase: Architecture and Design
Strategy = Separation of Privilege
Follow the principle of least privilege when assigning access rights to entities in a software system. Denying access to a file can prevent an attacker from replacing that file with a link to a sensitive file. Ensure good compartmentalization in the system to provide protected areas that can be trusted.
Observed Examples
CVE-2001-1042 FTP server allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files and directories by uploading a .lnk (link) file that points to the target file.
   Reference Description
      CVE-2000-0342 Mail client allows remote attackers to bypass the user warning for executable attachments such as .exe, .com, and .bat by using a .lnk file that refers to the
attachment, aka "Stealth Attachment."

CWE-64: Windows Shortcut Following (.LNK)

Reference Description
CVE-2005-0587 Browser allows remote malicious web sites to overwrite arbitrary files by tricking the user into downloading a .LNK (link) file twice, which overwrites the
file that was referenced in the first .LNK file.

                                Under-studied. Windows .LNK files are more "portable" than Unix symlinks and have been used in remote exploits. Some Windows API's will access LNK's as if they are regular files, so one would expect that they would be reported more frequently.
