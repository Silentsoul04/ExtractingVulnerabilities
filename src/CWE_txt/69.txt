CWE-69: Improper Handling of Windows ::DATA Alternate Data Stream
Description
The software does not properly prevent access to, or detect usage of, alternate data streams (ADS).
Extended Description
An attacker can use an ADS to hide information about a file (e.g. size, the name of the process) from a system or file browser tools such as Windows Explorer and 'dir' at the command line utility. Alternately, the attacker might be able to bypass intended access restrictions for the associated data fork.

CWE Version 4.2
CWE-69: Improper Handling of Windows ::DATA Alternate Data Stream
Language : Language-Independent (Prevalence = Undetermined)
Operating_System : Windows (Prevalence = Undetermined) Background Details
Alternate data streams (ADS) were first implemented in the Windows NT operating system
to provide compatibility between NTFS and the Macintosh Hierarchical File System (HFS). In HFS, data and resource forks are used to store information about a file. The data fork provides information about the contents of the file while the resource fork stores metadata such as file type.
Common Consequences
Potential Mitigations
Phase: Testing
Software tools are capable of finding ADSs on your system.
Phase: Implementation
Ensure that the source code correctly parses the filename to read or write to the correct stream.
