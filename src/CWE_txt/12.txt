CWE-12: ASP.NET Misconfiguration: Missing Custom Error Page
Description
An ASP .NET application must enable custom error pages in order to prevent attackers from mining information from the framework's built-in responses.
Relationships
The table(s) below shows the weaknesses and high level categories that are related to this weakness. These relationships are defined as ChildOf, ParentOf, MemberOr and give insight to similar items that may exist at higher and lower levels of abstraction. In addition, relationships such as PeerOf and CanAlsoBe are defined to show similar weaknesses that may want to be explored.
Applicable Platforms
756 Missing Custom Error Page 1393
     Language : ASP.NET (Prevalence = Undetermined) Background Details
The mode attribute of the <customErrors> tag defines whether custom or default error pages are used.
Common Consequences
Scope Impact   Likelihood
Confidentiality
Read Application Data
Default error pages gives detailed information about the error that occurred, and should not be used in production environments. Attackers can leverage the additional information provided by a default error page to mount attacks targeted on the framework, database, or other resources used by the application.
Potential Mitigations
Phase: System Configuration
Handle exceptions appropriately in source code. ASP .NET applications should be configured to use custom error pages instead of the framework default page.
Phase: Architecture and Design
Do not attempt to process an error or attempt to mask it.
Phase: Implementation
Verify return values are correct and do not supply sensitive information about the system.
