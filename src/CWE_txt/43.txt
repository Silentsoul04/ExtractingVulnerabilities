CWE-43: Path Equivalence: 'filename....' (Multiple Trailing Dot)
Description
A software system that accepts path input in the form of multiple trailing dot ('filedir....') without appropriate validation can lead to ambiguous path resolution and allow an attacker to traverse the file system to unintended locations or access arbitrary files.
