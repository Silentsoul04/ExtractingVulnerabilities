CWE-79 Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
The software does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes user-controllable input before it is placed in output that is used as a web page that is served to other users.

CWE-787 Out-of-bounds Write
The software writes data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

CWE-20 Improper Input Validation
The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly.

CWE-125 Out-of-bounds Read
The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

CWE-119 Improper Restriction of Operations within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer
The software performs operations on a memory buffer, but it can read from or write to a memory location that is outside of the intended boundary of the buffer.

CWE-89 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')
The software constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component.

CWE-200 Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor
The product exposes sensitive information to an actor that is not explicitly authorized to have access to that information.

CWE-416 Use After Free
Referencing memory after it has been freed can cause a program to crash, use unexpected values, or execute code.

CWE-352 Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
The web application does not, or can not, sufficiently verify whether a well-formed, valid, consistent request was intentionally provided by the user who submitted the request.

CWE-78 Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an OS Command ('OS Command Injection')
The software constructs all or part of an OS command using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended OS command when it is sent to a downstream component.

CWE-190 Integer Overflow or Wraparound
The software performs a calculation that can produce an integer overflow or wraparound, when the logic assumes that the resulting value will always be larger than the original value. This can introduce other weaknesses when the calculation is used for resource management or execution control.

CWE-22 Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal')
The software uses external input to construct a pathname that is intended to identify a file or directory that is located underneath a restricted parent directory, but the software does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname that can cause the pathname to resolve to a location that is outside of the restricted directory.

CWE-476 NULL Pointer Dereference
A NULL pointer dereference occurs when the application dereferences a pointer that it expects to be valid, but is NULL, typically causing a crash or exit.

CWE-287 Improper Authentication
When an actor claims to have a given identity, the software does not prove or insufficiently proves that the claim is correct.

CWE-434 Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type
The software allows the attacker to upload or transfer files of dangerous types that can be automatically processed within the product's environment.

CWE-732 Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource
The product specifies permissions for a security-critical resource in a way that allows that resource to be read or modified by unintended actors.

CWE-94 Improper Control of Generation of Code ('Code Injection')
The software constructs all or part of a code segment using externally-influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the syntax or behavior of the intended code segment.

CWE-522 Insufficiently Protected Credentials
The product transmits or stores authentication credentials, but it uses an insecure method that is susceptible to unauthorized interception and/or retrieval.

CWE-611 Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference
The software processes an XML document that can contain XML entities with URIs that resolve to documents outside of the intended sphere of control, causing the product to embed incorrect documents into its output.

CWE-798 Use of Hard-coded Credentials
The software contains hard-coded credentials, such as a password or cryptographic key, which it uses for its own inbound authentication, outbound communication to external components, or encryption of internal data.

CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data
The application deserializes untrusted data without sufficiently verifying that the resulting data will be valid.

CWE-269 Improper Privilege Management
The software does not properly assign, modify, track, or check privileges for an actor, creating an unintended sphere of control for that actor.

CWE-400 Uncontrolled Resource Consumption
The software does not properly control the allocation and maintenance of a limited resource, thereby enabling an actor to influence the amount of resources consumed, eventually leading to the exhaustion of available resources.

CWE-306 Missing Authentication for Critical Function
The software does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.

CWE-862 Missing Authorization
The software does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action.
